    <h2>Entry 1: 4/2/2022</h2>
    <p>
        The only problem that I encountered when working on this project was trying to add a photo of myself to the
        webpage.
        I wasn't sure if the photo needed to be on the web or not but I just tried a few different things and figured
        out that you can just link to the photo if it is in the working directory.
        I already knew the basics of HTML before starting this project, but I definitely needed a refresher which this
        assignment helped with.
        I've learned some different tags and I also learned how to actually publish a website for anyone to use.
        I used the class notes as a resource for this assignment because they are very easy to follow and have just the
        right information that I needed to get it done.
        Overall, this was a really fun project and I am excited to see what we will work on next!

    <h2>Entry 2: 4/25/2022</h2>
    <p>
        The challenging parts of this assignment were trying to get the padding and margins as close to the mocks as
        possible as well as positioning the elements in the right way.
        I was able to solve these problems by just trying different things until I eventually got everything to look the
        way I wanted.
        I learned a ton from this assignment. By spending time tinkering with different elements over and over, I now
        have a much better understanding of CSS and feel more comfortable using it.
        The recorded lectures and lecture notes are what I used to keep me on track for this project. I used the
        lectures when I needed to recall a specific topic we went over in class and I used the notes as a general cheat
        sheet while working.
        One thing that I had to google when working on this assignment was how to implement the pseudo-class for focus
        because I didn't know what it was called.

    <h2>Entry 3: 05/09/2022</h2>
    <p>
        This assignment was definitely the hardest so far, but at the end of the day I really enjoyed it. I learned the
        basics of JavaScript
        and I now have a foundation to build on in the future. Some problems I had include trying to delete elements
        from the DOM while still having
        a saved copy of them to use later in the program as well as handling new twits in the DOM. The site that helped
        me the most for this project
        was the MDN documentation website. It gave me the syntax that I needed when I got stuck with examples to help me
        understand. One thing I had to
        google for this assignment was how to remove elements from an array at once. All in all, this was a fun project
        that I would like to build upon.

    <h2>Entry 4: 05/16/2022</h2>
    <p>
        The difficult parts of this assignment include figuring out how to set up the files correctly so that the styles
        would show.
        Also, making sure the content types were set the right way gave me some trouble at first. I learned valuable
        information about
        servers from this assignment and I can now build off of this project to make it more complex. The resources that
        were helpful for
        this assignment were the recorded lectures as well as the Campuswire forum. Using the lecture code as reference
        helped me stay on
        track and Campuswire was there when I had more specific questions. One thing I had to google was the different
        content types to make
        sure I was using the right ones.

    <h2>Entry 5: 05/31/2022</h2>
    <p>
        This assignment was pretty difficult to understand at first, but after going through the material and
        documentation it started to make more sense as
        I went on. A specific problem that I encountered include getting my directories set up in a way that express
        handlebars would understand which took
        some time to understand. I learned a ton from this assignment although a lot of it was hard to understand at
        first but I am glad that I pushed through
        because the stuff that I learned is valuable and can definitely be used in the future for other projects. The
        resources that were helpful for
        this assignment were the recorded lectures as well as the Campuswire forum. Using the lecture code as reference
        helped me stay on
        track and Campuswire was there when I had more specific questions much like the other assignments. One thing
        that I had to google to complete this assignment
        was the handlebars helpers documentation because I needed to add an if helper and wanted to make sure I had the
        syntax correct so that I didn't run into any
        problems.
