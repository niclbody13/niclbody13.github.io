        <p>The only problem that I encountered when working on this project was trying to add a photo of myself to the webpage. I wasn't sure if the photo needed to be on the web or not but I just tried a few different things and figured out that you can just link to the photo if it is in the working directory.</p>
        <p>I already knew the basics of HTML before starting this assigment, but I definitely needed a refresher which this assingment helped with. I learned some different tags in this assignment and I also learned how to actually publish a website for anyone to use.</p>
        <p>I used the class notes as a resource for this assignment because they are very easy to follow and have just the right information that I needed for this assignment.</p>
        <p>Overall, this was a really fun assignment and I am excited to see what we will work on next!</p>
