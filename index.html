        <li>The most complex thing I have done with my current web development skills is creating a simple blackjack
            application using HTML and Javascript.</li>
        <li>I hope to learn more about web development in general and build the foundation of the skills I will be using
            in the foreseeable future.</li>
        <li>I have signed up for our Campuswire forum and I intend on using it very much throughout this term.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The most interesting fact about myself is that I broke the same arm twice within the same year.</p>
